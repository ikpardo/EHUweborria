title: We are partners of IKERGAZTE 5th edition
---

IkerGazte was conceived as a meeting point for the Basque researchers' communities in 2015. More than 8 years later, the 5th edition is knocking on the door. We are glad to announce that our research group, FisioKlima-AgroSost, has been recognized as an official partner. The conference will be held in Donostia between the 17th and the 19th of May and some of our younger members will be presenting. Come and join!
