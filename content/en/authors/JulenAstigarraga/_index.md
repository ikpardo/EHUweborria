My research focuses on quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of forest dynamics and their drivers, with a particular focus on the impacts of climate and land-use changes. To this end, I mainly used data from forest inventories, dendrochronology, satellite imagery and climate data, covering scales from local to hemispheric and time periods from a decade to a century. Using advanced computational and modelling techniques, my research aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of how forests might be affected by the increasing impacts of climate change and human activities, ultimately providing information on possible future trajectories. I am committed to open and reproducible science, contributing to the development of open source software and promoting the teaching and learning of good statistical and programming practices in the field of life sciences.
