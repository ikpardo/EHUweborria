Graduated in Biology and currently doing my PhD thesis in the Biodiversity, Ecosystem Functioning and Management doctoral programme at the UPV/EHU. My research field consists on studying how plant-pollinator interactions change over time and space, analysing the diversity of these interactions. In other words, I study the seasonal and spacial dynamics of plant-pollinator mutualistic relationship. For instance, I analyse  the restructurings caused by the different periods of flowering of plant species or by the arrival of different species into this mutualist network, in order to understand the functioning of ecosystems.
