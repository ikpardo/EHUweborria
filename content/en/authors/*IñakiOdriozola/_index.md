I am an ecologist interested in community ecology and the assembly processes that shape biodiversity. My research has focused mainly on studying the environmental (including natural and anthropic disturbances) and biotic processes that determine species distributions and diversity across space and time, as well as how these relate to ecosystem function. I have mainly worked with plant and microbial communities (fungi, bacteria and archaea, identified using molecular methods based on Next Generation Sequencing). Additionally, I have advanced knowledge on statistical modelling and I have imparted several courses on experimental design and data analysis.
