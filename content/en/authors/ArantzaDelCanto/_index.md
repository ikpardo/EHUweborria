My current research focuses on the symbiosis between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) under stress conditions, specifically under drought. I previously worked on projects related to the conservation of wild plant species and determination of germination protocols, at the Germplasm Bank of the Olaizu’s Botanical Garden (Vitoria-Gasteiz). I am interested in agroecology, crop science and its adaptation to future conditions in relation to climate change, from a sustainable perspective and most generally, I´m interested in the natural environment conservation.
