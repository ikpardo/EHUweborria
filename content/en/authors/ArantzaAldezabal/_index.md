I have more than 25 years of research experience investigating the soil-vegetation-herbivore interface in mountain ecosystems at both fine and coarse spatial scales, from individual traits to community responses. In the last years I have focused on the evaluation of the sustainability of mountain grazing systems, simulating scenarios of global change in order to foresee the consequences. To do this, I have promoted interdisciplinary research in collaboration with other research groups, with the aim of integrating the conservation of biodiversity and sustainability of livestock systems from a multifunctional point of view.
