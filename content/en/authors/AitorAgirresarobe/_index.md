I am Graduated in Biology and actually doing my PhD thesis in the Environmental Agrobiology doctoral program from the UPV/EHU. The aims of my work are, on the one hand, to investigate how the climate change associated salinity, elevated CO2, high temperature and their interactions, affect quinoa growth from a physiological and biochemical perspective. On the other hand, to clear up whether quinoa tolerance mechanisms would be strengthen under climatic change conditions and to find new and yet unknown tolerance mechanisms.
