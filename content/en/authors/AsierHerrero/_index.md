I am an ecologist mainly focused in the analysis of vulnerability and resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbances and stressors associated to global change. Management actions and strategies for forest ecosystems adaptation to climate change and the study of ecological mechanisms underlying species abundance and coexistence patterns are my secondary research lines.
