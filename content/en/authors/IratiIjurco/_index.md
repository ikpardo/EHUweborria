Due to my awareness of current environmental problems, I decided to study the Degree in Environmental Science (UPV/EHU). Over time, my interest in agriculture and its relationship with soil microorganisms grew, so I took a Master's Degree in Environmental Agrobiology (UPV/EHU and UPNA). Continuing with this subject, I began my pre-doctoral studies investigating the importance of the biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for a more sustainable agriculture, studying the effect that land management and organic farming can have on it.
