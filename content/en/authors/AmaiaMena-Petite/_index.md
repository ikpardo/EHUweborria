Graduated in Biology in 1992 and Doctor in Sciences since 2001 by the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). She has been a teacher at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the UPV/EHU since 1996. She is currently at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the UPV/EHU, and she has been a lecturer since 2008. She has three periods of six years for research recognized by CNEAI. She has the UNIBASQ positive evaluation level B3. She is excellent in dimension 2 of the DOCENTIAZ program, with a total score of 89.54 out of 100. She has participated as a researcher in 35 funded projects, currently in the FisioClimaCO2 group (Group A of the Basque University System). She is co-author of 61 publications, being 35 international articles with review (ISI Web of Knowledge). She has presented 91 communications to Congresses, being 26 International Congresses. She belongs to the Sociedad Española de Fisiología Vegetal (SEFV) and the Federation of European Societies of Plant Biology (FESPB). She has been a reviewer in several international journals. She has co-directed three Doctoral Theses, which two are international, the three of which deserved the highest qualification, and one of them deserved the VII Iberian Prize for Research in Water Relations (SEFV, 2012). Nowadays, she co-directs a Doctoral Thesis related to the mode of action of different alternative products to conventional phytosanitary products in the Vitis vinifera-Plasmopara viticola systems. She has also directed numerous master's degree projects, end-of-degree projects, DEAs, supervised internships in companies, voluntary internships in companies, etc. On the other hand, she has never neglected his own training and specialization as a teacher and researcher, making for this purpose more than 90 courses organized by various entities, including the SAE / HELAZ of the UPV/EHU, and has attended more than 45 seminars, workshops, etc. Her current research focuses on the mechanism of action of different substances alternative to phytosanitary products in the control of grapevine mildew with the aim of, first, identifying low-risk alternatives to phytosanitary products with proven efficacy in the control of these pathogens and, secondly, elucidating the mechanism of action of those products. Besides, she continues with the investigation of the combined effects that several factors associated with climate change (drought, high CO2, temperature) have on various plant species and crops.
