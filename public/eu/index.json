This area of research is important due to its potential applications in fields such as the agricultural and food industries. Studies are being carried out where biochemical and physiological characters related with increased tolerance capacity of the crops in the climatic conditions foreseen for the future are selected; However, the influence of these characters on the final production is not so studied, much less their influence on the quality of the grain. On the other hand, studies where the three factors are combined (high CO2, high temperature and drought) are not very abundant and, therefore, we cannot predict how plants will develop under future conditions. That is, we do not know if the mechanisms that allow the plant to benefit from the fertilizing effect of the high CO2 will be valid under the conditions combined with the high temperatures and drought expected. Therefore, the main objective of this research project is to determine which biochemical and physiological processes are involved in the interaction of combined conditions of high CO2, high temperature and drought, and to know through what mechanisms affect the growth, production and quality of the grain of two cultivars of barley. The key to this proposal is that the study will be multiscalar (physiological and molecular agronomic parameters) and multifactorial (high Tª, high CO2 and drought) which will allow a deep analysis of the interactions that will occur in future climatic conditions.\n","date":1616630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1616630400,"objectID":"a07c0f87a43d56e6526127953699b752","permalink":"/eu/project/2017-2018_cebadas/","publishdate":"2021-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/project/2017-2018_cebadas/","section":"project","summary":"Agricultural production is strongly influenced by climate, and any change in climate can reduce crop productivity and put the food security of the world\u0026rsquo;s growing population at risk.

The scenarios predict an increase in atmospheric CO2, a higher temperature and an increase in the intensity and duration of droughts, which will imply changes in productivity and quality. An alternative is the search for species more tolerant to these environmental stresses, quinoa being one of the possible species, thanks to its high tolerance to drought and salinity. In addition, it is necessary to reduce the use of organic and phosphorous fertilizers in order to reduce the environmental impact of both the contamination of fresh water reserves and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the fertilizer manufacturing process. For this, it is very important to promote ecological agricultural practices. In this sense, quinoa can also be a very interesting species to be cultivated through ecological agricultural practices since the demand is increasing due to its high nutritional value, higher than that of cereals with gluten; especially because of its high protein content (approximately 16%), its excellent digestibility (92%) and balanced content of essential amino acids, such as lysine and methionine, characteristics highly appreciated by groups committed to the environment and health. Although various studies are being carried out on its adaptation to different regions, there is still a long way to go to find the right variety, cycle and cultivation needs. Therefore, the objective of this research project will be, from a multiscalar analysis, on the one hand, to verify the degree of adaptation in the Alava plain of different quinoa cultivars and, on the other hand, to study the incidence of drought in production and grain quality in field studies using ecological agricultural practices.

Water use efficiency (WUE) is the trait that serves to describe this intimate link between the C and water cycles and is a crucial parameter incorporated in many land-surface-models to predict vegetation-climatic feedbacks under future climate change scenario. WUE can be estimated using multiple approaches and methodologies concerning different temporal spatial and temporal scales. Empirical comparison of WUE estimates reveal that important disagreements exists among methodologies; however, these empirical comparisons cannot reveal the underlying mechanisms driving these discrepancies. Two of the most widely used methodologies to estimate WUE are measurements of the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance to water, using gas-exchange techniques, and analyses of the carbon isotopic composition (d13C) of plant material. This latter approach is based on the assumption that the d13C of plant material is mostly the result of isotopic discrimination occurring during diffusion through the stomatal pores and fractionation at the point of carboxylation. The vast majority of these studies analyses d13C in either the leaves or the wood, but these reflect the signal of the plant physiological status all along the organ ontogeny. In addition, in tall trees, d13C varies greatly among leaves and thus individual measurements cannot capture whole-tree physiological status. Analyses of the phloem d13C constitute a promising avenue, as the phloem signal, when collected at the base of the trunk should reflect the whole tree physiological performance. Still, WUE estimates from d13C, even when they come from the phloem, are usually lower than WUE from measurements of gas-exchange. This is partly due the fact that estimates of WUE from d13C most often neglect the leaf internal resistance to CO2 diffusion, beyond the stomatal pores. Mesophyll conductance (gm) is the inverse of this resistance and it is a trait that varies greatly among plant functional types and in large individuals (adult trees) also among canopy layers. Furthermore, gm also varies greatly in response to climate change drivers including increasing vapour pressure deficit, water availability and atmospheric CO2concentration. Previous studies, including ours, combining measurements of gm with WUE from different estimates suggest that neglecting gm limitations in the calculations of WUE from d13C could induce large biases and that these biases would be even larger under water limitations.\nStill, these studies showed that even after incorporating gm limitations, other post-photosynthetic fractionation processes exist that underlie disagreements between WUE estimates. The aim of this proposal is to reconcile estimates of WUE describing vegetation functioning at different scales by incorporating internal leaf diffusional limitations, using Fagus sylvatica as a model species. This objective will materialise in the form of a novel protocol for estimating whole-tree WUE at large spatial scales from analyses of the phloem content. In this project, we will combine measurements under controlled conditions, intensive field measurements of physiological performance, sampling of physiological performance (including WUE from different methodolgies and gm) across a broad geographical range.\n","date":1616630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1616630400,"objectID":"2402f986da420c4e318e242427ae9fb1","permalink":"/eu/project/2020-2023_phlisco/","publishdate":"2021-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/project/2020-2023_phlisco/","section":"project","summary":"The exchange of water for carbon between the vegetation and the atmosphere constitutes the most important feedback mechanism underlying the regulation of water and carbon (C) cycles by the terrestrial biosphere.

Several studies have investigated the main traits that determine the competitive capacity of plant species, and although the relevance of the traits is not clear, traits both from belowground and aboveground have been observed. In this paper, we grew Trifolium pratense and Agrostis capillaris in intra- and interspecific competition, analyzing the photosynthetic metabolism and nitrogen uptake, among other variables. The results indicated that T. pratense possesses better competition ability due to the higher competitive performance for soil resources compared to A. capillaris, explained by a higher root biomass and a higher nitrogen uptake rate in the former than in the latter. These traits permitted T. pratense to show higher photosynthetic rate than A. capillaris when both species were grown in mixture. Furthermore, the interspecific competition provoked A. capillaris to activate its antioxidant metabolism, through SOD activity, to detoxify the reactive oxygen species generated due to its lower capacity for using the photochemical energy absorbed. In this experiment, we conclude that the competitiveness seems to be more related with soil resources competition than with light competition, and that the photosynthetic rate decline in A. capillaris is more a secondary effect as a consequence of nitrogen limitation.","tags":[],"title":"A physiological approach to study the competition ability of the grassland species Trifolium pratense and Agrostis capillaris","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaime Madrigal-Gonzalez","Joaquin Calatayud","Juan A.

To test these two contrasting hypotheses, we analyse the most plausible pathways in the richness-abundance relationship and its stability along global climatic gradients. We show that positive effect of species richness on tree abundance only prevails in eight of the twenty-three forest regions considered in this study. In the other forest regions, any benefit from having more species is just as likely (9 regions) or even less likely (6 regions) than the effects of having more individuals. We demonstrate that diversity effects prevail in the most productive environments, and abundance effects become dominant towards the most limiting conditions. These findings can contribute to refining cost-effective mitigation strategies based on fostering carbon storage through increased tree diversity. Specifically, in less productive environments, mitigation measures should promote abundance of locally adapted and stress tolerant tree species instead of increasing species richness.","tags":[],"title":"Climate reverses directionality in the richness–abundance relationship across the World’s main forest biomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriela Montes de Oca-Vasquez","Frank Solano-Campos","Jose R.

We evaluated the biomass, extracellular enzyme activities, and diversity of the soil microbial community, in a microcosm experiment as a function of time. After seven days of incubation, we found an increase in microbial biomass in an AgNPs-concentration-independent manner. In contrast, after 60-day-incubation, there was a decrease in Gram+ and actinobacterial biomass, in both soils and all AgNPs concentrations. Soil physico-chemical properties and enzyme activities were not affected overall by AgNPs. Regarding the microbial community composition, only some differences in the relative abundance at phylum and genus level in the fungal community were observed. Our results suggest that environmental concentrations of AgNPs affected microbial biomass but had little impact on microbial diversity and may have little effects on the soil biogeochemical cycles mediated by extracellular enzyme activities.","tags":[],"title":"Environmentally relevant concentrations of silver nanoparticles diminish soil microbial biomass but do not alter enzyme activities or microbial diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Vetrovsky","Daniel Morais","Petr Kohout","Clementine Lepinay","Camelia Algora","Sandra Awokunle Holla","Barbara Doreen Bahnmann","Kveta Bilohneda","Vendula Brabcova","Federica D'Alo","Zander Rainier Human","Mayuko Jomura","Miroslav Kolarik","Jana Kvasnickova","Salvador Llado","Ruben Lopez-Mondejar","Tijana Martinovic","Tereza Masinova","Lenka Meszarosova","Lenka Michalcikova","Tereza Michalova","Sunil Mundra","Diana Navratilova","Inaki Odriozola","Sarah Piche-Choquette","Martina Stursova","Karel Svec","Vojtech Tlaskal","Michaela Urbanova","Lukas Vlk","Jana Voriskova","Lucia Zifcakova","Petr Baldrian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b4f3f1edf8d3311e0059674bf91a89ca","permalink":"/eu/publication/2020-01-01_globalfungi_a_globa/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2020-01-01_globalfungi_a_globa/","section":"publication","summary":"Fungi are key players in vital ecosystem services, spanning carbon cycling, decomposition, symbiotic associations with cultivated and wild plants and pathogenicity.

The GlobalFungi database contains over 600 million observations of fungal sequences across \textgreater 17 000 samples with geographical locations and additional metadata contained in 178 original studies with millions of unique nucleotide sequences (sequence variants) of the fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 representing fungal species and genera. The study represents the most comprehensive atlas of global fungal distribution, and it is framed in such a way that third-party data addition is possible.","tags":[],"title":"GlobalFungi, a global database of fungal occurrences from high-throughput-sequencing metabarcoding studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Campion","Iker Pardo","Miguel Elosegui","Diego Villanua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"38d92677fb66b9739fce6ccd7559d787","permalink":"/eu/publication/2020-01-01_gps_telemetry_and_ho/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2020-01-01_gps_telemetry_and_ho/","section":"publication","summary":"The White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos is one the rarest and the most vulnerable woodpeckers in Europe. Intensive forest practices have caused a widespread decline of the species. In the Spanish Pyrenees, on the south-west limit of the species range, a population of the lilfordi subspecies (Lilford Woodpecker) is estimated at less than 200 individuals which are confined to a few relatively well-conserved beech forests. Despite being an endangered taxon, our knowledge about the size and shape of its home range is still incomplete. Conventional radio-tracking studies of the taxon have been limited due to the complex topography of forests, whereas miniaturized GPS devices have not been available for such a small bird (∼100 g bodyweight) until recently. Here, we evaluate for the first time the utility of modern lightweight GPS tags to characterize the home range of the White-backed Woodpecker. Using 3.4 g GPS-tags we tracked movements of 14 adult individuals during the breeding and post-breeding periods between years 2017–2019. On average, the failure rate (the percentage of failed fix attempts) was 30%, and 76% of successful fixes were accurate (error \textless 20 m). According to 95% kernel density estimator, the mean home range (∼300 ha) was several times larger than previously reported for the species, and it did not change over the post-breeding period. This finding challenges the utility of previous management recommendations for protecting small buffer areas around the nest or single forest stands. By modeling the home range size as a function of the number of fixes and errors, we found that males had significantly larger home ranges than females. Our results demonstrate that GPS telemetry is feasible in White-backed Woodpecker adults, and it can provide novel and accurate information about the home range of the species if potential sources of error are adequately addressed.","tags":[],"title":"Gps Telemetry and Home Range of the White-Backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos: Results of the First Experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Inigo Saiz-Fernandez","Maite Lacuesta","Usue Perez-Lopez","M.

However, high nitrogen concentrations can inhibit both shoot and root growth, even though the processes involved in this inhibition are still unknown. The aim of this work was to identify the metabolic alterations that induce the inhibition of root growth caused by high nitrate supply, when the whole plant growth is also reduced. High nitrate altered nitrogen and carbon metabolism, reducing the content of sugars and inducing the accumulation of Ca2+ and amino acids, such as glutamate, alanine and γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), that could act to replenish the succinate pool in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and maintain its activity. Other metabolic alterations found were the accumulation of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, and the reduction of jasmonic acid (JA) and the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). These results indicate that the growth root inhibition by high NO3- is a complex metabolic response that involves GABA as a key link between C and N metabolism which, together with plant growth regulators such as auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, JA, and the ethylene precursor ACC, is able to regulate the metabolic response of root grown under high nitrate concentrations.","tags":[],"title":"Interplay between 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, γ-aminobutyrate and D-glucose in the regulation of high nitrate-induced root growth inhibition in maize","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angela Casado-Garcia","Arantza del-Canto","Alvaro Sanz-Saez","Usue Perez-Lopez","Amaia Bilbao-Kareaga","Felix B.

Stomata facilitate gas exchange, being pivotal in the regulation of processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration. The analysis of the number and behaviour of stomata is a task carried out by studying microscopic images, and that can serve, among other things, to better manage crops in agriculture or to better understand how plants fix CO2 and lose water under different conditions. However, quantifying the number of stomata in an image traditionally has been a labor intensive and thus expensive process since an image might contain dozens of stomata. Several automatic stomata detection models have been developed and presented in the literature, but they fail to generalise to images from species different to those employed to train the model; and, in addition, they lack a simple interface to employ them. In this work, we tackle these problems by training a YOLO model. Such a model achieves a F1-score of 0.91 in images from the species employed for training it, and similar F1-score for datasets containing images of different species. Moreover, in order to facilitate the use of the model, we have developed LabelStoma, an open-source and simple-to-use graphical user interface that employs the YOLO model. In addition, this tool provides a simple method to adapt the YOLO model to the users’ images, and, therefore, customising the model to the users’ needs. Thanks to this work, the analysis of plant stomata of different species will be more reliable and comparable; and, the developed tools will help to advance our understanding of CO2 and H2O dynamics in plants, such as photosynthesis and transpiration, and ecosystems related processes, such as carbon and water cycles.","tags":[],"title":"LabelStoma: A tool for stomata detection based on the YOLO algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Besides, drought events will increase worldwide. These factors are affecting plant growth and crop production compromising food security. Within this context, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) is becoming an alternative pseudocereal for food supply due to its capacity to grow under harsh environmental conditions. Besides, it is being proposed as key model species to study the physiological processes that permit this tolerance, although how N metabolism responds has been barely studied. This paper addresses, on one hand, the response of quinoa's N metabolism (N uptake, translocation, reduction and assimilation) under the forthcoming climatic conditions and, on the other hand, the comparison of the effects of both stresses when plants have similar relative water content and photosynthetic rates. Under mild salt stress (120 and 240 mM NaCl) N assimilation is not affected, while the N uptake is favored. Under severe salt stress (500 mM NaCl), N uptake is reduced, decreasing leaf nitrate and protein concentration; nevertheless, leaf free amino acids are maintained –to perform osmotic adjustment–. N uptake rate is more affected under drought than under severe salt; furthermore, under severe salt stress, quinoa allocates more nitrogen to roots to finely regulate NO3− and Cl− uptake, while under drought it allocates more to leaves to ensure photosynthesis. These results indicate that quinoa's N metabolism is tolerant to drought and salt stress, although the strategies of this species for coping with the aforementioned stresses are different.","tags":[],"title":"N metabolism performance in Chenopodium quinoa subjected to drought or salt stress conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaquin Calatayud","Enrique Andivia","Adrian Escudero","Carlos J.

Abundant species monopolize negative associations in about 90% of the assemblages. On the other hand, rare species are mostly involved in positive associations, forming small network modules.

Conventional fertilizer was associated with a decrease in soil pH, an accumulation of Ag, Mn, As, Fe, Co, Cd, and Ni; and an enrichment of ammonia oxidizers and xenobiotic compound degraders (e.g., Candidatus Nitrososphaera, Nitrospira, Bacillus, Pseudomonas). Soils receiving organic fertilization were enriched in Ti (crop biostimulant), N, and C cycling bacteria (denitrifiers, e.g., Azoarcus, Anaerolinea; methylotrophs, e.g., Methylocaldum, Methanosarcina), and disease-suppression (e.g., Myxococcales). Some predicted functions, such as glutathione metabolism, were slightly, but significantly enriched after a one-time manure application, suggesting the enhancement of sulfur regulation, nitrogen-fixing, and defense of environmental stressors. The study highlights that even a single application of organic fertilization is enough to originate a rapid shift in soil prokaryotes, responding to the differential substrate availability by promoting soil health, similar to recurrent applications.","tags":[],"title":"Response of Horticultural Soil Microbiota to Different Fertilization Practices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Inaki Odriozola","Tijana Martinovic","Barbara Doreen Bahnmann","David Rysanek","Tereza Masinova","Petr Sedlak","Kristyna Merunkova","Petr Kohout","Michal Tomsovsky","Petr Baldrian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"23ed356481371c5c9578be60417b650f","permalink":"/eu/publication/2020-01-01_stand_age_affects_fu/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2020-01-01_stand_age_affects_fu/","section":"publication","summary":"Fungi are key mediators of ecosystem processes in temperate forests.

We assessed whether and how fungal community composition and productivity change along the forest age gradient. Stand age did not have any significant effect on fungal ergosterol content but community composition shifted with the stand age. In particular, the composition of the community of root-associated ectomycorrhizal fungi responded to stand age. Relative abundances of different fungal ecological guilds did not change with forest age and ectomycorrhizal exploratory types were not good predictors of community dynamics.

Greater biodiversity is expected to enhance stability across years by decreasing synchrony among species, but the drivers of stability in nature remain poorly resolved. Our analysis of time series from 79 datasets across the world showed that stability was associated more strongly with the degree of synchrony among dominant species than with species richness. The relatively weak influence of species richness is consistent with theory predicting that the effect of richness on stability weakens when synchrony is higher than expected under random fluctuations, which was the case in most communities. Land management, nutrient addition, and climate change treatments had relatively weak and varying effects on stability, modifying how species richness, synchrony, and stability interact.

We evaluated the specificity of whole-termite associated fungal communities in three wood-feeding termite species. We showed that the whole-termite fungal community spectra are stable over diverse environments, regardless of the host species, and differ markedly from the wood in which they nest. The core mycobiome is similar to that found in other ecologically related insects and consists of a narrow spectrum of common filamentous fungi and yeasts, known for their stress tolerance and their ability to decompose plant biomass. The observed patterns suggest that a number of fungal strains may have a symbiotic relationship with termites, and our results set the stage for future investigations into the interactions between fungi, termites, and their other gut microbiota.","tags":[],"title":"Termites host specific fungal communities that differ from those in their ambient environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Weborria amaitzear dago, ez ahaztu zure ekapenak martxoaren 30ra bainon lehenago bidaltzea.

In the protein-free PBS, the reactivity of SOCL for methylene blue (MB)-photosensitized 1O2 was found to be moderate or low. The reaction yield increased with temperature and/or concentration of dissolved molecular oxygen. Unexpectedly, the presence of BSA boosted both the emissive nature and the thermal stability of the phenoxy-dioxetane intermediate formed in the chemiexcitation pathway. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that SOCL has a moderate binding affinity for BSA and that entropy forces drive the formation of the SOCL-BSA complex. A model with two identical and independent binding sites was used to fit the binding isotherm data. Co-operative binding was observed when MB was present. Local viscosity factors and/or conformational restrictions of the BSA-bound SOCL phenoxy-dioxetane were proposed to contribute to the formation of the highly emissive benzoate ester during the chemically initiated electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL) process.

ANPP was measured monthly during the next three growing periods (2006–2008), and locally measured climate data were obtained from a public database. Because between-site variation in annual ANPP was not significant, we used data averaged across sites to test for the effect of monthly climate variability on monthly ANPP by means of dynamic regression. Enhanced ANPP was found after grazing abandonment, probably due to the sudden dominance of productive graminoids. Variation in monthly rainfall did not contribute to explain monthly ANPP under grazing or grazing exclusion. Simultaneous mean monthly air temperature explained monthly ANPP under grazing. By contrast, the effect of temperature on ANPP under grazing exclusion was delayed by 1 mo. We suggest that this delay can be explained by the development of a thick organic layer (litter) that insulated the soil in the grazing exclusion plots. However, changes in floristic composition and, consequently, in phenology might also have contributed to the differential response.","tags":[],"title":"Grazing Abandonment Delays the Effect of Temperature on Aboveground Net Primary Production in Atlantic Grasslands☆","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gorka Erice","Alvaro Sanz-Saez","Jon Gonzalez-Torralba","Ana Maria Mendez-Espinoza","Ines Urretavizcaya","Maria Teresa Nieto","Maria Dolors Serret","Jose Luis Araus","Juan J.

In particular, little is known about the variability and drivers of respiration in IRES sediments upon rewetting, which could result in large pulses of CO2. We present a global study examining sediments from 200 dry IRES reaches spanning multiple biomes. Results from standardized assays show that mean respiration increased 32-fold to 66-fold upon sediment rewetting. Structural equation modeling indicates that this response was driven by sediment texture and organic matter quantity and quality, which, in turn, were influenced by climate, land use, and riparian plant cover. Our estimates suggest that respiration pulses resulting from rewetting of IRES sediments could contribute significantly to annual CO2 emissions from the global stream network, with a single respiration pulse potentially increasing emission by 0.2–0.7%. As the spatial and temporal extent of IRES increases globally, our results highlight the importance of recognizing the influence of wetting-drying cycles on respiration and CO2 emissions in stream networks.","tags":[],"title":"Sediment Respiration Pulses in Intermittent Rivers and Ephemeral Streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon Miranda-Apodaca","Emilio L.

To evaluate current and future forests threats, a multi-proxy focus on the growth, anatomical and physiological responses to climate change is needed. We examined the long-term xylem adjustments to climate variability of the temperate Quercus robur L. at its rear edge and the sub-Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Both species coexist at a mesic (ME, humid and warmer) and a xeric (XE, dry and cooler) site in northern Spain, the latter experiencing increasing temperatures in recent decades. We compared xylem traits at each site and assessed their trends, relationships and responses to climate (1960–2008). Traits included basal area increment, earlywood vessel hydraulic diameter, density and theoretical-specific hydraulic conductivity together with latewood oxygen (δ18O) stable isotopes and δ13C-derived water-use efficiency (iWUE). Quercus robur showed the highest growth at ME, likely through enhanced cambial activity. Quercus pyrenaica had higher iWUE at XE compared with ME, but limited plasticity of anatomical xylem traits was found for the two oak species. Similar physiological performance was found for both species. The iWUE augmented in recent years especially at XE, likely explained by stomatal closure given the increasing δ18O signal in response to drier and sunnier growing seasons. Overall, traits were more correlated at XE than at ME. The iWUE improvements were linked to higher growth up to a threshold (\textasciitilde85 μmol mol–1) after which reduced growth was found at XE. Our results are consistent with Q. pyrenaica and Q. robur coexisting at the central and dry edge of the climatic species distribution, respectively, showing similar responses to buffer warmer conditions. In fact, the observed adjustments found for Q. robur point towards growth stability of similar rear-edge oak populations under warmer climate conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Coexisting oak species, including rear-edge populations, buffer climate stress through xylem adjustments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Usue Perez-Lopez","Cristina Sgherri","Jon Miranda-Apodaca","Francesco Micaelli","Maite Lacuesta","Amaia Mena-Petite","Mike Frank Quartacci","Alberto Munoz-Rueda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"055a9dbbe6433cd5b5b75acabbb4a49d","permalink":"/eu/publication/2018-01-01_concentration_of_phe/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2018-01-01_concentration_of_phe/","section":"publication","summary":"The present study was focused on lettuce, a widely consumed leafy vegetable for the large number of healthy phenolic compounds.

Under conditions of drought and severe saline stress (500 mM NaCl), highly similar reductions in growth and relative water content were observed. However, the strategies implemented by the plants in either stress condition and their relative importance were different. Under salt conditions, responses related to osmotic adjustment were more prominent than under drought conditions, where more dehydration was detected. In addition, despite a similar reduction in stomatal conductance in drought and saline conditions, a greater non-stomatal effect was observed in drought conditions, which was demonstrated by the fact that the intercellular CO2 concentration was increased. Moreover, the antioxidant metabolism also responded differently to the two stresses. Photoassimilate allocation was also different between treatments: the root/shoot ratio remained constant independent of salt concentration, whereas under drought conditions, this ratio increased. A similar trend between treatments was detected for water use efficiency, which was maintained under salt stress and increased under drought conditions, indicating that under reduced water conditions, quinoa can use lower amounts of water per unit of biomass production.

Although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) greatly reduce pollutant loads into the environment, excess nutrient loading is a problem in many streams. Using a Community and Ecosystem Function (CEF) approach, we quantified the effects of WWTP effluent on the performance of microbes and detritivores associated to organic matter decomposition, a key ecosystem process. We measured organic matter breakdown rates, respiration rates and exo-enzymatic activities of aquatic microbes. We also measured food consumption and growth rates and RNA to body-mass ratios (RNA:BM) of a dominant amphipod Echinogammarus berilloni. We predicted responses to follow a subsidy-stress pattern and differences between treatments to increase over time. To examine temporal effects of effluent, we performed a laboratory microcosm experiment under a range of effluent concentrations (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%), taking samples over time (days 8, 15 and 30; 4 and 10 replicates to assess microbe and detritivore performance respectively, per treatment and day). This experiment was combined with a field in situ Before-After Control-Impact Paired (BACIP) experiment whereby we added WWTP effluent poured (10 L s-1 during 20-40 min every 2 h) into a stream and collected microbial and detritivore samples at days 8 and 15 (5 and 15 replicates to assess the microbe and detritivore performance respectively, per period, reach and sampling day). Responses were clearer in the laboratory experiment, where the effluent caused a general subsidy response. Field measures did not show any significant response, probably because of the high dilution of the effluent in stream water (average of 1.6%). None of the measured variables in any of the experiments followed the predicted subsidy-stress response. Microbial breakdown, respiration rates, exo-enzymatic activities and invertebrate RNA:BM increased with effluent concentrations. Differences in microbial respiration and exo-enzymatic activities among effluent treatments increased with incubation time, whereas microbial breakdown rates and RNA:BM were consistent over time. At the end of the laboratory experiment, microbial respiration rates increased 156% and RN:BM 115% at 100% effluent concentration. Detritivore consumption and growth rates increased asymptotically, and both responses increased with by incubation time. Our results indicate that WWTP effluent stimulates microbial activities and alters detritivore performance, and stream water dilution may mitigate these effects.","tags":[],"title":"Testing wastewater treatment plant effluent effects on microbial and detritivore performance: A combined field and laboratory experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon Miranda-Apodaca","Usue Perez-Lopez","Maite Lacuesta","Amaia Mena-Petite","Alberto Munoz-Rueda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4ff865c743931a8a45aa9661b1ffc1e7","permalink":"/eu/publication/2018-01-01_the_interaction_betw/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2018-01-01_the_interaction_betw/","section":"publication","summary":"Climate change can have major consequences for grassland communities since the different species of the community utilize different mechanisms for adaptation to drought and elevated CO2 levels.

Thus, the objectives of this work have been to examine the effect of water stress on plant water relations in two grassland species (Trifolium pratense and Agrostis capillaris), analyzing the possible differences between the two species when soil water content is equal in all treatments, and to elucidate if development under elevated CO2 increases drought tolerance and if so, which are the underlying mechanisms. At ambient CO2, when soil volumetric water content was 15%, both species decreased their water potential in order to continue taking up water. Trifolium pratense performed osmotic adjustment, while Agrostis capillaris decreased the rigidity of its cell wall; moreover, both species increased the root to shoot ratio and decreased leaf area. However, these mechanisms were not sufficient to maintain cell turgor. Elevated CO2 partially mitigated the negative impact of drought on turgor potential in Trifolium pratense through a higher osmotic adjustment and root to shoot ratio and in Agrostis capillaris through a higher leaf relative water content caused by higher hydraulic conductance, but the impact of drought was not mitigated in either species by higher soil water conservation.","tags":[],"title":"The interaction between drought and elevated CO2 in water relations in two grassland species is species-specific","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maite Lacuesta","Inigo Saiz-Fernandez","Katerina Podlesakova","Jon Miranda-Apodaca","Ondrej Novak","Karel Dolezal","Nuria De Diego"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1d83333849e7ea92d7a76c08e90b358d","permalink":"/eu/publication/2018-01-01_the_trans_and_cis_ze/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2018-01-01_the_trans_and_cis_ze/","section":"publication","summary":"Abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, and cytokinins (CKs) are known to be closely linked to nitrogen signaling.

CKs also affect source-sink relationships in plants. Based on these results, we hypothesized that CKs regulate the source-sink relationship in maize via a mechanism involving complex crosstalk with the main auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and ABA. To evaluate this hypothesis, various CK metabolites, IAA, and ABA were quantified in the roots and in source and sink leaves of maize plants treated with high and normal nitrate concentrations. The data obtained suggest that the cis and trans isomers of zeatin play completely distinct roles in maize growth regulation by a complex crosstalk with IAA and ABA. We demonstrate that while trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine (iP) regulate nitrate uptake and thus control final leaf sizes, cis-zeatin (cZ) regulates source and sink strength, and thus controls leaf development.

Participants monitor regional-species distribution and local-population abundance for a wide variety of plant species: threatened, rare, and indicators of climatic change or habitats of interest. At the local abundance level (the novel “\textitAdopt-a-plant” program), they carry out annual censuses of population abundance for 10 years at least, to eventually estimate standard trends and future vulnerability. In order to show the functional structure of the network and facilitate implementation elsewhere, we evaluate the key aspects of MONITO, which currently involves 183 single-species or multi-species monitoring sites. We use the participant database, an anonymous survey, and the analyses of time invested in fieldwork training, participant turnover, and scientific assessment of monitoring quality.

This study evaluates individual tree response in a mixed forest by assessing how size and neighbourhood density modulated growth responses to climate among coexisting tree species. To understand the complete variation in growth responses to climate, it is necessary to consider intrapopulation variability. Trees respond as individual entities, and their response is modulated by their characteristics and neighbourhood context. To assess the individual climate sensitivity, all living Iberian birches, European beeches, and pedunculate oaks trees located in a temperate mixed forest were cored in four 40 m × 40 m plots. Standard ring-width chronologies were built at tree and species level for the 1977–2007 period. Chronologies were related to climatic variables (monthly precipitation, hailstorm and mean temperature, and summer (June–August) precipitation). Growth response to climate varied among species and individual trees. Differences in climate–growth relationship among species could be partially attributed to the different xylem anatomy, since secondary growth of ring-porous pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) was mainly dependent on the previous-winter climatic conditions (January temperature), while for the diffuse-porous Iberian birch (Betula celtiberica Rothm. and Vasc.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), spring temperature and summer precipitation were the major constraining factors of growth. Tree features and identity of neighbourhood modulated climatic response, especially for Iberian birch and pedunculate oak. Dominant trees in less crowded neighbourhoods responded more intensely to climate factors. Understanding the individual variability of growth responses to climate will provide more realistic predictions of forests response to climate change.","tags":[],"title":"Variation in the Climate Sensitivity Dependent on Neighbourhood Composition in a Secondary Mixed Forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cristina Sgherri","Usue Perez-Lopez","Francesco Micaelli","Jon Miranda-Apodaca","Amaia Mena-Petite","Alberto Munoz-Rueda","Mike Frank Quartacci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"471815094cdc5b16650fc3efdc2faaeb","permalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_elevated_co2_and_sal/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_elevated_co2_and_sal/","section":"publication","summary":"Both salt stress and high CO2 level, besides influencing secondary metabolism, can affect oxidative status of plants mainly acting in an opposite way with salinity provoking oxidative stress and elevated CO2 alleviating it.

The NAO therefore holds a great potential to evaluate the role, as carbon sinks, of water-limited forests under climate change. However, uncertainties related to inconsistent responses of long-term forest productivity to NAO have so far hampered firm conclusions on its impacts. We hypothesize that, in part, such inconsistencies might have their origin in periodical sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO). Here we show strong empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis using 120 years of periodical inventory data from Iberian pine forests. Our results point to AMO+ NAO+ and AMO−NAO− phases as being critical for forest productivity, likely due to decreased winter water balance and abnormally low winter temperatures, respectively.

Do these competitive intraspecific aggregations displace and exclude other species, thereby reducing species diversity? Location Atlantic grasslands, Aralar Natural Park, Basque Country, Northern Iberian Peninsula. Methods Large herbivores were experimentally excluded from three sites (50 m × 50 m exclusion fences) during 9 yr in a productive semi-natural grassland system with a long history of grazing, using adjacent grazed plots as experimental controls. Sampling was carried out by systematically placing 100 quadrats (0.5 m × 0.5 m) in each of the six plots. Floristic composition and abundance, as well as eight hydrological and chemical soil properties, were measured in each quadrat. The spatial structures created by competitive species were analysed using RDA in conjunction with Moran's eigenvector maps, and soil variables were simultaneously included in the analyses, thus disentangling the structures likely created by niche effects. Competitive exclusion was further determined using linear regressions between species richness and abundance of competitive species. Results Grazing exclusion unleashed competitive species such as Festuca microphylla and Agrostis capillaris, which became dominant in the exclusion plots and created large spatial patches. Furthermore, a negative linear relationship, consistent across exclusion plots, was observed between species richness and abundance of competitive species, indicating that strong above-ground competitors outcompeted other species when herbivores were excluded. However, the outcome of grazing exclusion across sites depended to some extent on local environmental conditions (niche effects). Conclusions This work confirms that the powerful equalizing mechanism of disturbance by herbivores is crucial for species co-existence in productive grasslands. However, important differences observed in environmental effects across sites suggest that, even in highly productive grasslands, plant traits and local environmental characteristics (niche effects) do matter for species co-existence.","tags":[],"title":"Grazing exclusion unleashes competitive plant responses in Iberian Atlantic mountain grasslands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alvaro Sanz-Saez","Robert P.

In order to maximize yields under future atmospheric [CO2], we need to identify and study crop cultivars that respond most favorably to elevated [CO2] and understand the mechanisms contributing to their responsiveness. Soybean (Glycine max Merr.) is a widely grown oilseed crop and shows genetic variation in response to elevated [CO2]. However, few studies have studied the physiological basis for this variation. Here, we examined canopy light interception, photosynthesis, respiration and radiation use efficiency along with yield and yield parameters in two cultivars of soybean (Loda and HS93-4118) previously reported to have similar seed yield at ambient [CO2], but contrasting responses to elevated [CO2]. Seed yield increased by 26% at elevated [CO2] (600 μmol/mol) in the responsive cultivar Loda, but only by 11% in HS93-4118. Canopy light interception and leaf area index were greater in HS93-4118 in ambient [CO2], but increased more in response to elevated [CO2] in Loda. Radiation use efficiency and harvest index were also greater in Loda than HS93-4118 at both ambient and elevated [CO2]. Daily C assimilation was greater at elevated [CO2] in both cultivars, while stomatal conductance was lower. Electron transport capacity was also greater in Loda than HS93-4118, but there was no difference in the response of photosynthetic traits to elevated [CO2] in the two cultivars.

On the contrary, recent theoretical developments argue that competitive exclusion may lead to patterns of either over-dispersion, clustering or randomness, depending on the relative importance of niche differences and interspecific competitive ability differences. In this study, we utilized semi-natural grassland communities to test the hypothesis that the pattern of species relatedness generated by competitive exclusion depends on species niche differences. Instead of inferring processes from observed patterns, we experimentally manipulated grassland plots to test the effects of competitive exclusion. We compared grazed plots (in which grazing functioned as an equalizing mechanism and suppressed aboveground competition) with neighbouring plots experimentally excluded from grazing over the course of nine years (in which aboveground competition was not prevented). Weak niche differences between species allowed competitive exclusion to generate phylogenetic clustering, because phylogenetically structured plant canopy height and capacity for lateral spread conferred superior competitive ability to grasses that outcompeted species in all dicot branches. By contrast, moderate niche differences allowed competitive exclusion to result in a random pattern of phylogenetic species assembly, because species niche differences partially counterbalanced competitive exclusion by superior competitors in the grass family. We conclude that patterns of species relatedness created by competitive exclusion in Iberian Atlantic grasslands depend on species niche differences. Competitive exclusion may cause differential patterns of phylogenetic assembly.","tags":[],"title":"Patterns of species relatedness created by competitive exclusion depend on species niche differences: Evidence from Iberian Atlantic grasslands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaime Madrigal-Gonzalez","Asier Herrero","Paloma Ruiz-Benito","Miguel A.

Understanding demographic mechanisms underlying resilience (i.e. capacity of a system or individual to restore its structure and function prior to a disturbance) is critical for properly assessing forest vulnerability to drought. The simultaneous estimation of resilience of the main demographic rates governing tree population dynamics (growth, recruitment and survival) allows for a comprehensive assessment of forest response capacity. We evaluate the resilience of a large Pinus pinaster forest (approx. 7500ha) in Southern Europe to one of the driest decades of the last 70years (i.e. 1942–52). As forest structure and management influence demographic rates, their effects were removed prior to calculating resilience values for growth, recruitment and survival. The extremely dry conditions negatively impacted tree growth and recruitment during drought and slightly decreased survival in the decade after drought. Resilience values were mostly high, despite some low values for recruitment or survival in some forest sections, which indicate a general recovery of growth and recruitment and an absence of widespread reductions in survival after drought. A joint analysis of the Demographic Resilience Index (calculated by combining growth, recruitment and survival resilience; DRI) and resilience values of each rate allows to detect demographic compensation effects. High DRI values, even in sections where resilience in recruitment or survival was low, indicate that low resilience values in a given rate were compensated by high resilience in the remaining rates. Recorded resilience could allow the long-term persistence of the studied forest, although increased frequency and intensity of droughts might exceed the critical threshold of system’s resilience. Our approach provides a step toward an exhaustive resilience assessment; however, further research should consider potential resilience thresholds arising from more complex non-linear dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Resilience to drought in a dry forest: Insights from demographic rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lur Epelde","Anders Lanzen","Iker Mijangos","Estibaliz Sarrionandia","Mikel Anza","Carlos Garbisu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"c5c10955f331b7686a121605c55881a6","permalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_short-term_effects_o/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_short-term_effects_o/","section":"publication","summary":"Mountain grasslands in the Iberian Peninsula are the result of extensive grazing.

Sites were divided between 4 habitat types with different elevation, pasture productivity, vegetation type and parent material. Herbivores appeared to influence plant community composition, contributing to increase aboveground diversity, while having unequal effects on belowground communities depending on the organisms analysed. This may be explained by the different habitat and trophic level of each soil organism, which may be more or less affected by the predominating negative effects of grazing, such as soil compaction, and only partially compensated by other positive effects. Finally, habitat type appeared to be the strongest influence on both above- and belowground communities, also influencing the effect of the absence of grazing.","tags":[],"title":"Short-term effects of non-grazing on plants, soil biota and aboveground-belowground links in Atlantic mountain grasslands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Inigo Saiz-Fernandez","Nuria De Diego","Bretislav Brzobohaty","Alberto Munoz-Rueda","Maite Lacuesta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"371f6473b41ead32666d3bb43b6b7ec4","permalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_the_imbalance_betwee/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_the_imbalance_betwee/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitrogen (N) is an important regulator of photosynthetic carbon (C) flow in plants, and an adequate balance between N and C metabolism is needed for correct plant development. However, an excessive N supply can alter this balance and cause changes in specific organic compounds associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including plant growth regulators. In previous work, we observed that high nitrate supply (15 mM) to maize plants led to a decrease in leaf expansion and overall biomass production, when compared with low nitrate supply (5 mM). Thus, the aim of this work is to study how overdoses of nitrate can affect photosynthesis and plant development. The results show that high nitrate doses greatly increased amino acid production, which led to a decrease in the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate, the main source of C skeletons for N assimilation. The concentration of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (and possibly its product, ethylene) also rose in high nitrate plants, leading to a decrease in leaf expansion, reducing the demand for photoassimilates by the growing tissues and causing the accumulation of sugars in source leaves. This accumulation of sugars, together with the decrease in 2-oxoglutarate levels and the reduction in chlorophyll concentration, decreased plant photosynthetic rates. This work provides new insights into how high nitrate concentration alters the balance between C and N metabolism, reducing photosynthetic rates and disrupting whole plant development. These findings are particularly relevant since negative effects of nitrate in contexts other than root growth have rarely been studied.","tags":[],"title":"The imbalance between C and N metabolism during high nitrate supply inhibits photosynthesis and overall growth in maize (Zea mays L.)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaquin Calatayud","Jaime Madrigal-Gonzalez","Ernesto Gianoli","Joaquin Hortal","Asier Herrero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f4ed44084af5aa073e04cfd7d2005899","permalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_uneven_abundances_de/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/publication/2017-01-01_uneven_abundances_de/","section":"publication","summary":"Nestedness is a common pattern in interaction networks. However, its ecological and evolutionary meaning is under debate. Evidence shows that nestedness in mutualistic networks may be just a consequence of the species–abundance distribution. This has been questioned as abundance itself could be influenced by differences in generalism between species. Host-parasite networks in plant communities also show nested patterns, but their relationship with abundance has been seldom addressed. Importantly, an assessment of the potentially different effect of the number of interacting species (i.e. generalism levels) on the size of parasite and host populations can help understanding the role of abundance in determining both generalism and nestedness. Here we show that nestedness follows abundance expectations in an interaction network of climbing plants (i.e. structural parasites) and their tree and shrub hosts. Our results also point to a direct effect of abundance on both nestedness and generalism levels because species degree does not deviate from abundance expectations for both climbing plants and their hosts. Further, we found a similar level of discordance between generalization (a generalism measure independent of species abundance) and abundance for both parties. Our findings provide evidence that the factors underlying uneven abundance distributions can induce nestedness in interaction networks. We stress the importance of neutral processes related to species dominance as major determinants of nestedness in host-parasite networks.","tags":[],"title":"Uneven abundances determine nestedness in climbing plant-host interaction networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Utilizaremos una combinación de modelos correlacionales y de proceso para comprobar hipótesis sobre los mecanismos que confieren estabilidad frente a la sequía (resistencia y resiliencia) a diferentes niveles de organización, con énfasis en el papel desempeñado por los legados y la \u0026ldquo;memoria\u0026rdquo; del sistema. A escala de árbol, la propuesta se centra en investigar cómo diferentes dendro-fenotipos modulan la respuesta de los individuos a eventos climáticos extremos, así́ como su base genética. Utilizaremos el concepto de umbrales de vulnerabilidad como un indicador de alerta temprana para evaluar de forma retrospectiva los episodios de sequía y la muerte provocada por golpes de calor. Estos episodios pueden modificar la composición del rodal y provocar la contracción local de la distribución de las especies salvo que mecanismos demográficos compensatorios amortigüen estos impactos. Por este motivo desarrollaremos un modelo de dinámica forestal que integra el crecimiento con otros parámetros poblaciones -reclutamiento, mortalidad e interacciones entre individuos - y que utilizaremos para identificar mecanismos que controlan la resiliencia de la comunidad. Utilizaremos modelos jerarquizados bayesianos para constreñir el modelo con datos de diferentes niveles de organización e incluiremos variables clave identificadas en los modelos de antecedente estocásticos (SAM). Usaremos el simulador forestal para investigar las reglas de ensamblaje de especies a lo largo de gradientes de aridez, la existencia de memoria y la importancia de los legados en la dinámica forestal y en la resiliencia. Se utilizará un enfoque basado en rasgos funcionales para investigar la dominancia y la estabilidad de diferentes tipos funcionales después de la sequía y reducir la complejidad del modelo. Finalmente, desarrollaremos modelos estocásticos analíticos simples para investigar cómo se propagan los efectos de la memoria a lo largo del tiempo. A nivel del ecosistema, describiremos la estabilidad de la productividad forestal a través de modelos correlacionales calibrados con observaciones de sensores remotos. Se proporcionará una caracterización espaciotemporal de la heterogeneidad estructural más detallada que la de los inventarios de campo y se investigará la existencia de mecanismos compensatorios a nivel de ecosistema y, esta información se utilizará para constreñir los modelos de simulación forestal. Finalmente, integraremos las series de datos previas y los resultados del modelo en un Análisis de Riesgos Probabilístico a múltiples escalas que nos permita llevar a cabo predicciones de riesgo, incluido un análisis de errores, para las principales formaciones forestales ibéricas. Estableceremos un protocolo de transferencia de la evaluación de riesgos a las partes interesadas para llevar establecer categorías de vulnerabilidad y riesgo para las principales formaciones forestales, desarrollar indicadores de proceso y priorizar recursos en adaptación.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"575a1be37c007a63d517bb923815e838","permalink":"/eu/project/2019-2021_datadrivenforest/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/project/2019-2021_datadrivenforest/","section":"project","summary":"El proyecto DARE (\u0026ldquo;Modelos empíricos de la vulnerabilidad y resiliencia de los bosques a la sequía a diferentes escalas espacio- temporales: aplicación a la estrategia española de adaptación al cambio climático\u0026rdquo;) tiene como objetivo identificar mecanismos clave (desde el individuo al ecosistema) que subyacen a la resiliencia de los bosques frente a sequias extremas, y cuantificar la vulnerabilidad y riesgo para diferentes tipos de bosque.

En zonas limitadas por la escasez de agua, como es el caso de la cuenca Mediterránea, los eventos de sequía extrema podrían reducir drásticamente la productividad forestal y desencadenar fenómenos de decaimiento particularmente en poblaciones situadas en el límite meridional de sus rangos de distribución. Por tanto, es crucial identificar aquellos mecanismos que confieren estabilidad a las comunidades frente a eventos de sequía. Experimentos llevados a cabo con pastizales apoyan la hipótesis de que la biodiversidad confiere estabilidad frente a perturbaciones y otros cambios ambientales a través de \u0026lsquo;efectos portafolio\u0026rsquo; y \u0026lsquo;efectos de selección. Es decir, un mayor numero de especies aumentan la probabilidad de que alguna de ellas presente mecanismos funcionales para sobrellevar los cambios ambientales y mantener el funcionamiento de la comunidad dentro de unos niveles de estabilidad. La longevidad de las plantas herbáceas, la escasa estructuración en tamaños así como las limitaciones espacio-temporales de estos experimentos dificulta no obstante la generalización a bosques. Además de la diversidad funcional, la estructuración de la comunidad en función de los tamaños/edades de los individuos que la componen condicionan los procesos funcionales de la comunidad; y previsiblemente la resistencia y resiliencia frente a eventos de sequía. Un tamaño diferente implica tanto mecanismos de diferenciación de nicho como respuestas diferenciales del crecimiento a lo largo de gradientes ambientales. Por tanto, la heterogeneidad estructural (es decir, el aumento de la variedad de tamaños o edades) podría incrementar la estabilidad de la comunidad con mecanismos similares a los descritos para la diversidad funcional. El objetivo principal de este estudio es analizar el papel potencial de la diversidad funcional y estructural como estabilizadores de la productividad forestal frente a la sequía. Prestaremos especial atención a las transiciones en donde especies en su borde xérico de distribución conviven con especies tolerantes al estrés. Nuestro objetivo será́ comprender de qué manera los efectos de la diversidad sobre el individuo (en relación a su respuesta frente a sequias extremas) escalan a nivel de la comunidad. Para ello utilizaremos aproximaciones y observaciones complementarias en el espacio y en el tiempo (dendrocronología, inventarios forestales y modelización principalmente). El objetivo final será́ desarrollar un modelo de diagnóstico para evaluar la vulnerabilidad de algunas de las principales tipologías forestales ibéricas al cambio climático a partir de información de respuestas previas en el tiempo y de los patrones actuales de diversidad funcional y estructural a lo largo de gradientes ambientales. El reto principal es el de proporcionar bases científicas para el desarrollo de una selvicultura de adaptación al cambio climático mediante el control de la estructura y la diversidad funcional de la comunidad. Este conocimiento es necesario para incrementar la estabilidad de zonas forestales con un alto valor ecológico, económico y social, pero muy vulnerables al cambio climático.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"eu","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"508674dbc51c0bffcff42f2d08edcccb","permalink":"/eu/project/2016-2018_vulneracion/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/eu/project/2016-2018_vulneracion/","section":"project","summary":"Las ultimas predicciones del IPCC sugieren un aumento en la frecuencia e intensidad de las sequias con consecuencias muy negativas sobre procesos fundamentales de la biosfera como la productividad primaria neta o el reciclado de nutrientes para las próximas décadas.
