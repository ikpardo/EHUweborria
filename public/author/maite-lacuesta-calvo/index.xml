      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alternaria is a very common fungal genus, including numerous saprophytic, endophytic, and pathogenic species widely distributed in soil and decaying organic matter. It includes pathogenic species that can invade vegetable crops before and after harvesting and is responsible for considerable economic losses, due to the fact that it reduces the yield of the crops and produces alterations in the vegetables during their storage. Species of the genus Alternaria synthesize more than 70 secondary metabolites toxic to plants (phytotoxins), some of which also affect people and animals, which is why they are considered mycotoxins. The main mycotoxins produced by the main toxigenic species of the genus Alternaria do not depend on the host species, and are altenuene(ALT), alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA) and tentoxin (TEN). It is important to note that mycotoxin synthesis depends both on the presence of the producing Alternaria species and on environmental conditions.
Exposure to the toxins of Alternaria spp. it has been linked to the occurrence of adverse health effects in humans and animals and, in many cases, has been shown to have genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and cytotoxic effects. The mycotoxins of Alternaria spp. have been isolated from fruits (apple, pear, melon, apricot, grapes, raisins, strawberry, olive, citrus and dried figs), vegetables (tomato, pepper and carrot) and tubers (potato), as well as from numerous processed foods with contaminated raw materials (juices, preserves, sauces, etc.). Therefore, the objective of this project is to evaluate the presence of mycotoxigenic fungi of the genus Alternaria and the production of their mycotoxins in foods of plant cultivated in the Basque Country.
We will provide data to prepare a risk analysis of Alternaria mycotoxins in different foods consumed in the Basque Country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will define which foods for human consumption are those with the highest risk of containing Alternaria and its mycotoxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will establish the environmental conditions (seasonal risk) where the appearance of Alternaria and its mycotoxins is minimum and maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will define the guidelines for storage and handling of food to reduce the presence of Alternaria and its mycotoxins&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quinoa- ¿Opción de cultivo en Álava? Búsqueda de variedades productivas y de alta calidad bajo condiciones climáticas actuales y futuras</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change supposes an alteration of the main environmental factors that affect the productivity and quality of crops that, together with the increase in food demand by the world&amp;rsquo;s largest population, puts future food security in risk. The scenarios predict an increase in atmospheric CO2, a higher temperature and an increase in the intensity and duration of droughts, which will imply changes in productivity and quality. An alternative is the search for species more tolerant to these environmental stresses, quinoa being one of the possible species, thanks to its high tolerance to drought and salinity. In addition, it is necessary to reduce the use of organic and phosphorous fertilizers in order to reduce the environmental impact of both the contamination of fresh water reserves and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the fertilizer manufacturing process. For this, it is very important to promote ecological agricultural practices. In this sense, quinoa can also be a very interesting species to be cultivated through ecological agricultural practices since the demand is increasing due to its high nutritional value, higher than that of cereals with gluten; especially because of its high protein content (approximately 16%), its excellent digestibility (92%) and balanced content of essential amino acids, such as lysine and methionine, characteristics highly appreciated by groups committed to the environment and health.
Although various studies are being carried out on its adaptation to different regions, there is still a long way to go to find the right variety, cycle and cultivation needs. Therefore, the objective of this research project will be, from a multiscalar analysis, on the one hand, to verify the degree of adaptation in the Alava plain of different quinoa cultivars and, on the other hand, to study the incidence of drought in production and grain quality in field studies using ecological agricultural practices.
The approach will range from production studies to molecular and biochemical analyzes, allowing the interrelation between different study scales and obtaining results of both basic and applied knowledge, with the aim of maintaining food security in future climatic conditions and under premises of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
