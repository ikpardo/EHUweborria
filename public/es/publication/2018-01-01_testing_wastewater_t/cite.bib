  abstract = {The amount of pollutants and nutrients entering rivers via point sources is increasing along with human population and activity. Although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) greatly reduce pollutant loads into the environment, excess nutrient loading is a problem in many streams. Using a Community and Ecosystem Function (CEF) approach, we quantified the effects of WWTP effluent on the performance of microbes and detritivores associated to organic matter decomposition, a key ecosystem process. We measured organic matter breakdown rates, respiration rates and exo-enzymatic activities of aquatic microbes. We also measured food consumption and growth rates and RNA to body-mass ratios (RNA:BM) of a dominant amphipod Echinogammarus berilloni. We predicted responses to follow a subsidy-stress pattern and differences between treatments to increase over time. To examine temporal effects of effluent, we performed a laboratory microcosm experiment under a range of effluent concentrations (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%), taking samples over time (days 8, 15 and 30; 4 and 10 replicates to assess microbe and detritivore performance respectively, per treatment and day). This experiment was combined with a field in situ Before-After Control-Impact Paired (BACIP) experiment whereby we added WWTP effluent poured (10 L s-1 during 20-40 min every 2 h) into a stream and collected microbial and detritivore samples at days 8 and 15 (5 and 15 replicates to assess the microbe and detritivore performance respectively, per period, reach and sampling day). Responses were clearer in the laboratory experiment, where the effluent caused a general subsidy response. Field measures did not show any significant response, probably because of the high dilution of the effluent in stream water (average of 1.6%). None of the measured variables in any of the experiments followed the predicted subsidy-stress response. Microbial breakdown, respiration rates, exo-enzymatic activities and invertebrate RNA:BM increased with effluent concentrations. Differences in microbial respiration and exo-enzymatic activities among effluent treatments increased with incubation time, whereas microbial breakdown rates and RNA:BM were consistent over time. At the end of the laboratory experiment, microbial respiration rates increased 156% and RN:BM 115% at 100% effluent concentration. Detritivore consumption and growth rates increased asymptotically, and both responses increased with by incubation time. Our results indicate that WWTP effluent stimulates microbial activities and alters detritivore performance, and stream water dilution may mitigate these effects.},
