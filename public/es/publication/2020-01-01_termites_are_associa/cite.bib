  abstract = {\textlessp\textgreaterAll termites have established a wide range of associations with symbiotic microbes in their guts. Some termite species are also associated with microbes that grow in their nests, but the prevalence of these associations remains largely unknown. Here, we studied the bacterial communities associated with the termites and galleries of three wood-feeding termite species using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that the composition of bacterial communities differs among termite bodies, termite galleries, and control wood fragments devoid of termite activities, in a species-specific manner. Termite galleries were enriched in bacterial OTUs belonging to Rhizobiales and Actinobacteria, which were often shared by several termite species. The abundance of several bacterial OTUs, such as \textitBacillus, \textitClostridium, \textitCorynebacterium and \textitStaphylococcus, was reduced in termite galleries. Our results demonstrate that both termite guts and termite galleries harbour unique bacterial communities.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessp\textgreater\textbfImportance As it is the case for all ecosystem engineers, termites impact their habitat by their activities, potentially affecting bacterial communities. Here, we studied three wood-feeding termite species and found that they influence the composition of the bacterial communities in their surrounding environment. Termite activities have positive effects on Rhizobiales and Actinobacteria abundance, and negative effects on the abundance of several ubiquitous genera, such as \textitBacillus, \textitClostridium, \textitCorynebacterium and \textitStaphylococcus. Our results demonstrate that termite galleries harbour unique bacterial communities.\textless/p\textgreater},
